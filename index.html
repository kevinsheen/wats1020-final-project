				<h2>Major Content For Site</h2>
				
				<p>Include most of the site content in this section. Lots of information. Introductions to
				   the site and what it can offer the people.</p>
				
				<p>Maybe a follow up to what the site offers. Go into further details regarding these
				   highlighted artists and what they are up to lately. Mention areas they are from.</p>
				
				<p>Going to have to find places for venue information and incorporate maps. Give updates
				   regarding tour dates and upcomimg albums. Talk about thier specific band sites and
				   where you can purchase merchandise.</p>
				
				<p>Also, this is just a mock-up for understanding how mobile-first works and getting
				   comfortable with that process. A lot of layout will change. Wanted to go through
				   some tutorials to get an idea of how it all works. Thanks!</p>
