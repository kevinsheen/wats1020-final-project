=======
Week 7 Requirements
This phase of the Final Project work is dedicated to planning your design and presentation of your page. You must create some design documents so that when you move into your build phase you have a clear plan to follow.

For this assignment you will _place your design documents into the "/design/" directory_ within your fork of the assignment repository.

_Basic Requirements_

Written concept of what you plan to do.
Wireframe and/or design comps of at least 2 major states of your page (mobile and desktop, for example)
List of third party libraries or modules you plan to use.

_Stretch Requirements_

Additional design documentation (additional comps, wireframes, storyboards, etc.)
Storyboards showing how your page will change in reaction to the user, screen size, etc.
Extra design resources you plan to use, such as images, icons, fonts, etc.

_Deliverables_

URL of the repository for your fork of the assignment repository (with files placed in a directory called "design" within your fork)
Note about how the project went for you. In your note, you may want to discuss:
Were there any particularly difficult/easy elements?
What part did you enjoy the most/least?
If you had time to do it over again, what would you be sure to do differently?
